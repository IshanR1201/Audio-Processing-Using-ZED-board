# Audio-Processing-Using-ZED-board
In this course and project, we cover the basic tutorials on the implementation of the Zynq book. We use Vivado to implement the block designs. Next we will discuss the Tutorial 1 and Tutorial 2:
- Tutorial 1: Creating a First IP Integrator design
- Tutorial 2: Expanding the basic Integrator design using Vivado.
In tutorial 1 we create a simple Zynq embedded system which uses a General purpose I/O controller in the Zynq device â€“ in our case the ZEDboard Developement kit. This GPIO controller connects to the LED outputs and is also connected to the Zynq processor via the AXI bus connection.

The ZEDboard features are:
- 512 MB DDR3
- 256 Mb Quad-SPI Flash
- USB OTG 2.0 and USB UART
- Audio Codec preinstalled
